# Alert plugins (definition section)
#
# An Alert plugin is a Python module that implements a single class derived
# on Alert from Shine.HA.alerts.

# Assign Alert channels (defined above) for each Alert level.

# There are three available Alert levels: INFO, WARNING and CRITICAL.

#
# fs_monitor_state_count_thresholds is used to set the max number of acceptable
# occurrences of a component in the same state (by state).
#
# The maximum corresponding time is (value x polling_interval)
#
# A value of 2 means that if the state is only seen once during one
# polling_interval run loop, no alert is triggered.
#
# You can mitigate alerts on transcient states (like a failover) by adjusting
# these values.
#
# NOTE: shine-HA will alert on:
#   NO_DEVICE, OFFLINE, TARGET_ERROR, RECOVERING
#
# Target OK if state is MOUNTED or MIGRATED
# Target IGNORED if state is EXTERNAL or INACTIVE
#
fs_monitor_state_count_thresholds:
    #
    # COMPONENT_STATE: [INFO, WARN, CRIT]
    #
    # Note: if for example INFO == WARN, this will disable INFO alerting.
    #
    # Again, multiply these values by polling_interval to get time in seconds.
    #
    NO_DEVICE: [2, 2, 4]        # both target and md device not started
    OFFLINE: [4, 4, 6]          # target offline but block device started
    TARGET_ERROR: [10, 10, 20]  # this can be a transient state and not an error
    RECOVERING: [4, 20, 30]     # alert if recovery takes a very long time
