.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header
The
.Nm
file controls the behavior of
.Xr shine 1
command. It is located in the
.Pa /etc/shine
directory and is only needed on the management(s) node(s).
.Pp
The configuration is made up of several lines of paramaters such as:
.Pp
.D1 Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value
.Pp
where
.Ar key
represents a parameter name, and
.Ar value
would be the parameter's assigned value.  Lines that begin with a # are
treated as comments.

.Ss General
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic lmf_dir Ns = Ns Ar pathname
is the directory where model files are looked for, in 
.Ic install Ns 
 command. Default is
.Pa /etc/shine/models .
.It Ic lustre_version Ns = Ns Ar x.y.z
The Lustre version of the filesystem Shine is managing. This is used to 
handle incompatibilities between several Lustre releases. By example,
set it to 
.Pa 1.8 Ns
 if you are using any of 1.8 Lustre version.
.El

.Ss Storage backend
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic backend Ns = Ns None|File|ClusterDB
specifies selected storage backend type. If this variable is set to
.Ic None Ns ,
storage information is retrieved directly from each Lustre model file
(this way, storage info like device names is not centralized).
If this variable is set to
.Ic ClusterDB Ns ,
storage, filesystem and mount information is retrieved and stored from
tables lustre_ost, lustre_mdt, lustre_mount and lustre_fs of ClusterDB.
If backend is set to
.Ic File Ns ,
storage information is retrieved from
.Ar storage_file
and status information is stored in
.Ar cache_dir
directory on the management node. 
Default is
.Ic None Ns .
.El

.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic status_dir Ns = Ns Ar pathname
is the cache directory used for status information.
Default directory is

.Ss Command line interface
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic color Ns = Ns Ar [auto, always, never]
